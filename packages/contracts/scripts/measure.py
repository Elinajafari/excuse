"""Measure, do not estimate. Write the numbers into README.md.

    python scripts/measure.py            # measure and print, write nothing
    python scripts/measure.py --write    # measure and write between the markers

Three sections of the README are generated, between `<!-- measured:NAME:start -->`
and `<!-- measured:NAME:end -->`:

    tests        the suite's own count, from a run made now
    mutations    the mutation table, from a run made now
    deployment   the live run, rendered from deployments/studionet.json, or a
                 plain "not deployed yet" until the deploy and seed scripts have run

It refuses to write anything if the suite is red, if a mutation escapes, or if
the recorded deployment is not of the contract file in this repository.
